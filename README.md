# INTRA-DAY-TRADING-TIME-SERIES

Intra Day trading is the process of buying and selling equities within one day. It could be as simple as buying stocks of one company in the morning and selling them at the end of the day (4 pm to be precise). Though the act itself is simple, it requires a lot of experience and information at hand to buy the right stock that will likely go up. Day trading is very risky because of the short-term behavior of markets that reflect billions of rapidly fluctuating values responsive to evolving conditions that approximate a random walk. Over 95% of traders lose money.

Trading requires a lot of attention and sensitivity to the market. Experienced traders rely on multiple sources of information, such as news, historical data, earning reports and company insiders. Risk is high and many variables needed to be considered.

For that reason, some financial institutions rely purely on machines to make trades. That means a computer with high-speed internet connections can execute thousands of trades during a day making a profit from a small difference in prices. This is called high-frequency trading. No human can compete with these algorithms, theyâ€™re extremely fast and more accurate.
